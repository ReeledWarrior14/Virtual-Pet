# Virtual-Pet

Your goal is to get 50 food in 20 turns and don't forget to feed your pet! Take turns feeding your pet and getting food! If you don't have enough food to feed your pet then you will lose. Your pet uses 3 food per turn. You can get 10 food but be careful as it may take 3 to 5 turns! The "Take a chance" button can give or remove food and will take a lot of turns. Have fun!
